            <h3>Fun Facts!</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pandas have excellent camouflage for their habitat.</li>
                <li>Mother pandas keep contact with their cub nearly 100% of the time during their first month - with the cub resting on her front and remaining covered by her paw, arm or head. 
                </li>
                <li>Giant pandas are good swimmers and excellent tree climbers. At 5 months old, giant panda cubs learn how to climb - sometimes practising by climbing on their mum. 
                </li>
                <li>They have an extended wrist bone that they use like a thumb to help them grip food.
                </li>
                <li>Pandas need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation
                </li>
                <li>A panda's diet is 99% vegetarian, which mostly includes bamboo roots, stems, shoots and leaves. However their digestive system is typical of a carnivore, so the remaining 1% of their diet can include eggs, small animals and carrion. Pandas are also known to forage in farmland for pumpkin, kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food.</li>
                <li>Pandas sometimes do handstands when they wee!
                    Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up. </li>
            </ol>
